# Web 2 Cohort X Final Project: A Recipe Page
#### *by Atiloye, Adu*

This is a self-made project for my Web 2 training. I built the whole site from scratch, and it's simply a site for viewing recipes that have been pre-inputted. Hopefully, there will be improvements in the future.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic JavaScript Model

### What I learned

I  had some difficulties understanding how to use flexbox in order to make the nav bar responsive. In addition, there were several issues that arose when trying to work with multiple pages efficiently due to it being cumbersome.
This project helped me understand how to use CSS Grid effectively in order to create a responsive layout  that works well across smaller screen sizes.
This project helped me understand how to structure an  application in a way that is easy to maintain and update. It also showed me how important it is to keep track of pages, pathing and stylesheets.

### Continued development

I still have some incompete pages and javascript for this project due to PC issues and exams in school, so, I plan to pick it up and continue after all is resolved and sorted.
I would like to continue learning about responsive design techniques such as media queries and how to use them effectively in my projects. Additionally, I would like to continue learning about accessibility, organization and planning.

In the JS part, I would like to add more functionality to it such as filtering through categories or showing only certain types of search results.
